# Automated birthday wisher
#In this project, we build a happy birthday email to our friends and family. We can not remember everybody's date of birth, so we made this program, and it will be the automated birthday wisher. We create a spreadsheet of all of our friend's birthdays and then create a bunch of emails, and we will randomly pick an email to send to each of these friends.
